<p><em>What is politicking and how is it related to a person&#39;s locus of control?  Briefly describe the three dimensions you should &quot;consider when determining if and how to engage in politicking&quot;. Knowing this information, how do you think you will engage in politicking in the future?</em></p>
<p>Politicking is the use of power and information to move resources toward preferred objectives. More specifically, politicking in workplaces is advocating for your interests in a way that meets your and your company’s objectives. For this reason, if anyone practicing politicking at workplaces would have to clarify first on what he/she really wants to accomplish along with finding out what the company’s objectives are.</p>
<p>Like some people including myself, the term politicking conjures up negative idea or connotation as we’ve experienced many politicians or business people using politics in a way they want using various means such as proficient speech for their personal achievement or success. Just like communication is unavoidable, politicking, in my opinion, exists everywhere including workplaces as long as we are alive because people pursue self-interest instinctively.</p>
<p>For example, I have heard from my previous co-worker quite a while ago that he was experiencing politicking in his workplace due to company re-organization. Since people knew their team would be merged or replaced soon, they were proactively brainstorming followed by seeking best solutions in order to remain in the same positions. And some of those activities included checking with their direct manager or manager’s managers on how things would be changed and demonstrating their capability so that they wanted to prove that they were valuable within the organization.</p>
<p>In terms of locus of control, those who do not want to be involved in politicking due to negative impression throughout experience tend to be strong external locus of control believing they have little or no control over external events thus reducing their level of politicking as a waste of time and effort. On the other hands, those who are well aware of concept of politicking as the art of the possible tend to be strong internal locus of control believing they can make differences directly or indirectly within the organization thus increasing their level of politicking as well as developing effective communication skills.</p>
<p>Whether we are internal or external in locus of control, there will be times we need to engage in politicking and there are three dimensions to consider when determining if and how to engage in politicking: <strong>Analyzing myself, reading others, and assessing the organization.</strong></p>
<p>Analyzing myself will include clear understanding of myself such as my strengths or weaknesses, what I like or dislike, and recognizing my specific characteristics whether I am logical or articulate etc. Analyzing myself need to be done in a way that I can maximize my strength in order to meet company’s needs.  As an example, if I think I am good at in multi-tasking as well as concentration, I will try to make sure my manager clearly understands that acknowledging not only in front of me but also in team meetings.</p>
<p>Next important factor is reading others’ feeling by engaging in various non-verbal cues as well as paying attention to their verbal expressions. Since we are social creatures, we coexist and affect to one another. If my manager shows his uncomfortable feeling, I might have to figure out what’s causing it especially whether it could be related to my work performance or not. Asking some high context questions like “How’s everything going?” might be able to shed some lights in some cases. If not and if I need to engage in politicking, I will have to diligently work on finding out the reason via multiple channels such as face to face meeting informally with my coworkers. At this point, I will at least show or express that I genuinely care for his/her worries so that we could work together to reduce the pain.</p>
<p>The last factor in engaging politicking is organization assessment. In order to assess the organization, we need to observe organizational norms and cultures such as checking working hours if it is flexible or not or whether casual dress code is acceptable or asking questions to departmental administrative staff and so on. After these observations are completed, I can evaluate and jump in to the world of politicking that can maximize my contribution within the organization.</p>
<p>My major step in politicking within workplaces will be building positive relationships as Steven Covey mentioned, “When the trust is high, communication is easy, effortless, its instantaneous, and it is effective— it works.” Whenever I meet people, I will always try to be on time or 5 minutes earlier, be aware of my facial expression and body movement, listen intently and paraphrase to understand clearly. In addition, I will try to express gratitude, respect and kindness to each and every co-worker as well as my manager without showing favoritism. In order to do this, I will have to keep practicing self-management and relationship management if I am ready to share issues that I need to resolve. Once I am ready, will try to meet people over lunch or some other occasions proactively. By building positive relationship, I will achieve my goal as well as my company goal.</p>
