#### Four stages in group Problem Solving via meetings

<pre><code>Question:

Your text discusses Fisher's four stages in group problem solving.  How do groups move through these stages and how is the knowledge of these four stages helpful to groups as they work to accomplish a task?

</code></pre>

In “Communicating at work,” Aubrey Fisher identified four stages in Group problem solving meeting: orientation(forming), conflict(storming), emergence(norming), and reinforcement(performing). (page 233) I think these are well formatted and good to know before joining or conducting any business meeting.
 
<strong>In orientation or forming phase</strong>, participants are working on clarifying tasks, roles, and responsibilities to accomplish their goal. When discussing in this stage, it’s important to encourage everyone’s participation. It is because members who have participated in forming or orientation meeting in early stage of project tend to work harder until project ends. Also, in this stage, members will share their knowledge, expertise, and preferences so that the amount of work can be equally and reasonably distributed among team members. Additionally, but most importantly, it’s a good time to build positive relationships at this stage for smooth working together in upcoming stages.
 
<strong>In conflict or storming phase,</strong> participants are brainstorming and working together solving problems and resolving issues at hand. Sometimes, there will be some conflicts due to different opinions in handling and resolving issues. So, lots of discussions and additional meetings using various business channels will be created for expression of different viewpoints. This phase can be either tough or smooth depending on the relationship built in forming or orientation stage. If we have built positive win-win relationship in forming stage, this phase can be moved smoothly because members will be cooperative and collaborative trusting one another.
 
<strong>In emergence or norming phase,</strong> members will follow established rules and regulations supporting the final decisions. Communication in this phase is less polarized and members back off from their firm positions. At this phase, harmony is the theme requesting and providing constructive feedbacks on individual and group actions.  Members feel superior to other groups especially when they think they have successfully delivered their product and so groupthink may be a risk at this phase.
 
<strong>In reinforcement or performing phase,</strong> members not only accept the decision but also actively endorse it. (page 233) They also encourage one another to do better and develop mechanism for ongoing self-assessment and group assessment. Postmortem will be performed at this stage which is an open discussion or brainstorming on team’s achievement specifically on what has done well and what needs more improvement. At this time, choosing nominal group technique (NGT) will be the best option as it will generate a greater number of high-quality suggestions. I’ve seen many postmortems done using post-its anonymously as it will reduce the dominance of few talkative members and lessens the potential for harmful conflicts.
 
In conclusion, having the knowledge of these four stages is very helpful in a way that members can prepare in advance on what needs to be done in each project milestone. Consequently, members can deliver the best possible product at the end of their hard work without regretting on what they have missed or feeling guilty of mistakes caused by lack of information.
