# Successful Team

#### My thought on successful team at workplaces

<pre>
Question: Too often the group experience ends in frustration.  Which three suggestions offered in the section, "What Makes a Group a Team," do you think are most likely to help a workplace group be a successful and satisfying experience?

<p>
Sometimes groups or teams experience frustration. One of the main reasons in light of my past work experience is members’ dissatisfaction within a team and another reason was due to lack of information or guideline on goal or purpose because not enough time was given for new members to train themselves especially in fast paced work environment. Our book “Communicating at work” suggests that “True teams have all the attributes of a group, but they have other qualities that distinguish them and make them more satisfying to work in and more productive.” (page 188) In order to make successful and satisfying experience within a team, I have three suggestions that I think will be crucial to create a successful team spirit: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>First and the most important factor is ‘clear and inspiring shared goals’.</strong> This is the source that make members do their best even in difficult situations. In this has three small topics: First, the goal should be clearly understood by each member. It may take some time to be fully understood but at least HR or team leader need to inform members that they have a clear goal at the beginning of working together. Second, the goal should be inspiring and this is very important. If a goal is just to make money, it is not quite convincing to some members causing weak cohesiveness and lack of motivation. For example, I once had a chance to work in a console game live team and suffered from lack of motivation and intention in spite of the fact that the work I was doing was the exact type of work I wanted to do. The reason why I had a hard time in this team was because I had to deal with games that were bloody and scary killing people in some games and so I faced some serious ethical dilemma if I can continue staying in this team or not. Third and the last, the goal should be aligned with each member’s goal, otherwise, it will not be easy to bring member’s attention and motivation.

<strong>Second factor to make a successful and winning team is “competent team members.”</strong> In my experience, if all team members are competent, it is likely to succeed whereas any team member is incompetent, some team members will have to help and support the incompetent member in order to achieve the team’s goal. Having competent skill generally means members should have problem solving skill in addition to have the exact required skills in job description. For example, three people named ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ put skill named ‘Z’ in their resumes but managers will try to select the best candidate using the method of residues, a process of elimination in which potential candidates are gradually rejected for lacking problem solving capability until only one remains. (page 194) 

Furthermore, being competent means that it should include not only having the skill necessary to accomplish the goal but also having proper communication and/or interpersonal skill via self-management and relationship management. The reason why competence should include communication or interpersonal skill as well is because no matter how competent a person is if he/she doesn’t communicate or express properly, it can be useless and can’t be utilized within a team. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third factor to make a successful and winning team is “collaborative climate.”</strong>  Even though team members are highly competent, if team environment is not collaborative, it will not be a successful team. For example, I have seen that some highly technical people sometimes don’t cooperate within a team but rather act like bullies using their weapons of specialty. Thus, even though they have enough skills to accomplish the goal, still some people or entire team will suffer from workplace bullies and so it is likely to end up with failing instead of succeeding in the long run. 
</p>
In conclusion, working in a successful and winning team requires three factors (1) Clear and inspiring shared goals (2) Competent team members and (3) Collaborative and positive climate. In reality though, it will not be easy to find this perfect combination of workplaces in today’s busy and competitive work environment. In most instances, if any team has a clear and inspiring goal, their team members will not be competent enough. In other instances, if members are competent enough, they are not collaborative and so on. The important lesson here is that I need to prepare to have my own clear and inspiring goal, need to be more competent, and should be collaborative creating positive climate instead of searching for this perfect combination of workplace.
