##EQ: Emotional Intelligence Question

#####What is Emotional Intelligence and how does it differ from other aspects of self-development (i.e. task competence, organizational skills, time-management etc.)? The concept of EQ is sometimes attacked as “just a bunch of common sense that applies to kids who don’t know any better and not experienced professionals in the workplace.”  Why is emotional intelligence a critical workplace competency? What would the author of the article say to individuals who may argue that the workplace doesn't need to be so "touchy-feely"?
 
<b>Emotional Intelligence is an awareness of myself and my relationship with others.</b> Having strong emotional intelligence means, according to Travis Bradberry, they have an ability to accurately perceive personal emotions and stay flexible leading to positive directions in behavior. As a result, they focus on managing emotions of self so that their relationship with others can improve in home and at workplaces.
 
While EQ is more related to emotions, self-development is more related to functions and technics. Many people try to improve their skills as part of their self-development such as technical skills or organizational skills so that they can get promoted at workplaces. However, if self-development is not accompanied by self-awareness, they can bear no fruit and suffer from lost jobs or broken relationships.
 
For example, I have seen many intelligent people who are superior in technical knowledge but still have to leave their workplaces due to broken relationship with their managers or co-workers. I also have experienced that people including managers like those who have less functional skills but great interpersonal skills than high functional skills but poor interpersonal skills. All these facts teach me that I need to be aware of my emotions and take care of other’s emotions for better interpersonal skills.
 
David Stauffer suggests some tips and exercises in his “Boosting your emotional intelligence” to ask myself several times a day the following self-awareness question:<ol>
- What am I feeling right now?
- What do I want?
- How am I acting?
- What appraisals am I making?
- What do my sense tell me?
</ol>
Additionally, Goleman says “Optimism is an attitude that buffers people against falling into apathy, hopelessness, or depression in the face of tough going… Optimism and hope can be learned.”
 
Finally, I think enhanced self-awareness and practicing for more skillful self-management is like being a tortoise in Aesop’s fable practicing anger management so that whenever hares make fun of him, he can persevere and continue his job. Whereas, striving for self-development without self-awareness is like being a hare who is much superior than tortoise but cannot continue his job because he is exhausted and that he needs to take a nap.
